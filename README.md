# Textbook Trade

## Description

Textbook Trade is a peer-to-peer marketplace web application specifically designed to allow users to buy and sell used textbooks. There are many online applications that allow users to buy and sell items, but the intent of Textbook Trade is to provide a streamlined, focused, and easy to navigate user experience. Users can create an account, search the textbook marketplace, create transactions, view a history of transactions, and post their own books for sale.

Textbook Trade is powered by quite a few different technologies. The two most prominent technologies that our team explored while working on this project were GraphQL and React.
